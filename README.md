# Orr-Sommerfeld Stability Analysis

This project implements a numerical solution to the **Orr-Sommerfeld equation** for analyzing the linear stability of Poiseuille flow, a parallel shear flow with a parabolic velocity profile. The code computes the eigenvalue spectrum, perturbation profiles, and neutral stability curve using the **Finite Difference Method (FDM)**.

## Overview

The Orr-Sommerfeld equation is a fundamental tool in hydrodynamic stability, used to determine whether small perturbations in a flow decay (stable) or grow (unstable), potentially leading to turbulence. This implementation focuses on:
- **Poiseuille flow**: A parabolic velocity profile \( U(y) = 1 - y^2 \) in a channel domain \( y \in [-1, 1] \).
- **Temporal stability analysis**: Solving the eigenvalue problem to find complex wave speeds \( c = c_r + i c_i \), where \( c_i > 0 \) indicates instability.
- **Numerical approach**: Discretizing the equation using FDM and solving the resulting generalized eigenvalue problem.
- **Outputs**: Eigenvalue spectra, perturbation profiles (\( v \)- and \( u \)-perturbations), and the neutral stability curve.
